  	<h1>Java:</h1>
  	<p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented,[15] and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to "bytecode" that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2018, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[18] [19] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>
