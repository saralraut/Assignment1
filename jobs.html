				<h1 class=""><strong>This article will uncover the differences between a web designer and developer, while explaining when to use each one.</strong></h1>
				<p class="ans">Website builders might offer the easiest way to get online, but getting professional help will likely provide bigger and better results (at more of cost than website builders, of course).

					And lots of people do seek outside help – a recent study found 73% of businesses are investing in web design to differentiate their online image.

				What’s the difference between a web designer and developer, exactly? They both help build websites, but they’re involved in very different areas. Developers build the site’s core structure using complex coding languages, while designers are more visually creative, focusing on the user.</p>

				<h1 class="qns">What is a web designer?</h1>

				<p class="ans">A web designer makes your website look good. They focus on the style and overall feel of the page, using software like Photoshop to customize the website’s visual elements. They also use code like HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create their designs.</p>
				<h1 class="qns">User Experience (UX) designer </h1>
				<p class="ans">A UX web designer’s job is to keep your visitors hooked. They know exactly how to craft a website that your specific audience will enjoy because they’ve carried out thorough research into the users’ demographics and website-needs, not to mention tons of prototype testing and site restructuring.</p>
				<hr>
				<h1 class="qns">What is web developer?</h1>
				<p class="ans">
					Part of a web developer’s role is to build the a web designer’s concept. Like we said earlier, web developers are similar to those who build, and web designers like the visionaries. A developer usually specializes in designing website apps – a web designer focuses more on what the user will enjoy doing.

				How does the relationship between developers and designers work? A web developer builds a website’s framework using software like Javascript and JQuery, aiming to craft a smooth-running website, which web designers then pour their creative juices onto. Like designers, there are specific roles for web developers, which we’ll highlight below.</p>

				<h1 class="qns">Back-end developer</h1>
				<p class="ans">The back-end is where the website’s core structure is designed. These developers are experts in programming and using complex software languages like Java, SQL and C#. The work they do is not seen by users because it involves coding on the web servers and databases, not on the browser (unlike front-end developers, which you’ll soon find out).

				In short, their job is to create logical, functional websites using various programmes. They also spend a lot of time testing and fixing bugs</p>

				<h1 class="qns">Full-stack developer</h1>
				<p class="ans">A full-stack developer works across different layers – or stacks – including both the front and back end. It is essentially the full package when it comes to web development, because they are an expert in all areas.</p>

				<h1 class="qns">You now know the differences between a designer and developer. This is important stuff to know because knowing when to hire each one will make your website-related life much easier. For a quick overview on when to choose each one, take a look at our table below.
