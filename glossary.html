		<h1><strong>Backlinks:</strong></h1>
		<p class="review1">Backlinks are links from other websites 'back' to your own. That could be a link on a Partners page, a Better Business Bureau listing, a reference to your product in a blog post, or much more. Backlinks are considered by Google's ranking algorithm and can affect your search rankings, but there are many specifics, like quantity, quality, and anchor text.</p>

		<h1>Error 404:</h1>
		<p>A 404 error message means the page you're trying to reach cannot be found. This can happen if you link to a page that doesn't exist, or if a page is taken down and the link remains up.</p>
	<hr>
		<h1>Fold:</h1>
		<p>In web design terms, "fold" is the line past which someone has to scroll to see more content. Everything that shows up when a page first loads is "above the fold" and "below-" or "after the fold" refers to the content further down the page. The term comes originally from newspapers, as the top half of the front page was "above the fold," and is where the major stories and images were placed for maximum effect.</p>
	<hr>
		<h1>Search Engine:</h1>
		<p>A search engine is a program that searches documents (i.e. web pages, which are HTML documents) for specified keywords and returns the list of documents. A search engine has two parts, a spider and an indexer. The spider is the program that fetches the documents, and the indexer reads the documents and creates an index based on the words or ideas contained in each document.</p>
